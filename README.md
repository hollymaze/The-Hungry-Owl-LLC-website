# The-Hungry-Owl-LLC-website
A mock website created for local restaurant, The Hungry Owl LLC.
Created as my first built-from-scratch website to practice HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript skills. Modeled after an actual business, but is not intended to become a live website, so no back-end functionality has yet been developed. I am currently still in the process of adjusting the layout (particularly image sizing) for the auxillary pages, as well as adding JS functionality, which is coming soon.
